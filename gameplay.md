## Gameplay
A player enters the realm, where they are required to sign a TX on the Bostrom blockchain to initiate their first pack of cards. This is basically the minting process.

The minting process requires a valid Bostrom account to sign the first TX. It will also require some BOOT tokens to pay for the gas during the minting process. That TX will provide the player an airdrop of X playing cards.

The TX should be signed with a Bostrom key, as this will connect the data of the player's Bostrom account, which the game requires to manage the various threats of the robots / cards. I.e. strength, HP, etc

Cards are generated randomly, but the larger the brain of a neuron is (the more cyberlinks an account has), the more chances of getting a special card or a card with extra multiplicators. Cards are minted with 0 attributes.

There are 9(?) races, each has their own special attributes. Some are more scarce than others. 

Attributes are a direct correlation with the data of an account. Kw aka battery is the health of an account. Volts are the strength. Amperes are accuracy or defense points. These are assigned by players manually or automatically to each card before a battle.

Leveling up your robots only works by interacting with the Bostrom blockchain. Players cards receive attributes according to the account's balance resources and update by making a manual TX on the interface and signing it with your Bostrom key.

Players have a limited number of actions per 24 hours. Players that delegate to the Citizen Cosmos validator can get bonus to their cards - more moves per day. And are subject to claim cashback bonuses in BOOT tokens. 

The cashback comes from the Citizen Cosmos validator, which will use a portion of its BOOT reward supply to spread between its delegators that are players and another portion to acquire PLASMA tokens and burn them.

Players can choose to be roboreeders or robovelopers. Neurons (accounts) on the Bostrom blockchain with high amount of cyberlinks may choose to simply mint new cards to trade on the market. Accounts that have higher number of V and A might prefer to add attributes to cards and progress in the game. 

Players may choose to in breed robots by paying PLASMA and locking the cards in purgatory pools for 9 days. After the 9 days, players will get a new, improved, one of a kind card.

# Game of life

An NFT, turn-based, battle-card game, built on top of the Bostrom blockchain, that utilizes data from the chain itself. 

Bostrom, built with Cosmos-SDK, Tendermint and IPFS, allows for adding knowledge (creating cyberlinks between particles) to the knowledge graph verifiably. The knowledge graph is a directed weighted graph between particles (CIDs or Content-ID of files, also known as content addresses, IPFS-hashes, IPFS-links). To create cyberlinks, a user accounts (neurons) must have V and A tokens.

The Bostrom universe is built around robots. One of the uses of the chain itself is a playground for AI. The robots are part of the story, etc.

Our idea is to create a collectable-battle card-game, in which, users will be motivated to use the blockchain itself, to acquire attributes for their cards and to earn further in-game rewards. 

The main goals of the game are:

- Get Cyber users to investment and cyberlink 
- Gamify the complexity of Bostrom
- Drop to users of the Cosmos ecosystem
- Arouse interest from various Cosmos ecosystems by integrating them into the gameplay
